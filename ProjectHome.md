This project was my submission to a job interview process. I am making it open source so other may benefit from my spent time.

It started out as a blocking (one-thread-per-user) TCP/IP chat server. I have since moved to a nonblocking server, which uses the apache MINA project.

Please note: this is mostly a learning project, and does not really contain any code I would use anywhere. You've been warned. That being said, please get in touch if you have questions.
