		<h3>...software for that certain kind of Bride</h3>
		<p>You know the type. She has been reading wedding magazines for
			months. She knows the wedding costs more than her future husband's
			car. But, it is OK, you see, because she must get married. Still,
			there is one thing missing, she just cannot figure out what it is. Of
			course! A software product specifically built to help her (or her
			wedding planner) meticulously plan ever detail down to the swan
			feather colors!</p>
